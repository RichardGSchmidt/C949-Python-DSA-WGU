#   7.12 LAB: Nutritional information (classes/constructors)
#   Complete the FoodItem class by adding a constructor to initialize a food item. 
#   The constructor should initialize the name (a string) to "Water" and all other instance attributes to 0.0 by default. 
#   If the constructor is called with a food name, grams of fat, grams of carbohydrates, and grams of protein, 
#   the constructor should assign each instance attribute with the appropriate parameter value.
#   
#   The given program accepts as input a food item name, amount of fat, carbs, and protein, and the number of servings. 
#   The program creates a food item using the constructor parameters' default values and a food item using the input values. 
#   The program outputs the nutritional information and calories per serving for a food item.
#   
#   Ex: If the input is:
#   
#   Water
#   the output is:
#   
#   Nutritional information per serving of Water:
#     Fat: 0.00 g
#     Carbohydrates: 0.00 g
#     Protein: 0.00 g
#   Number of calories for 1.00 serving(s): 0.00
#   Ex: If the input is:
#   
#   M&M's
#   10.0
#   34.0
#   2.0
#   3.0
#
#   where M&M's is the food name, 10.0 is the grams of fat, 34.0 is the grams of carbohydrates, 2.0 is the grams of protein, and 3.0 is the number of servings, the output is:
#   
#   Nutritional information per serving of M&M's:
#     Fat: 10.00 g
#     Carbohydrates: 34.00 g
#     Protein: 2.00 g
#   Number of calories for 1.00 serving(s): 234.00
#   Number of calories for 3.00 serving(s): 702.00
#
#   Note: The program outputs the number of calories for one serving of a food and for the input number of servings as well. 
#   The program only outputs the calories for one serving of water.
